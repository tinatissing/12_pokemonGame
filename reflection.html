<h2>Reflection</h2>

    <p class = "big">I think the course content learned throughout my three years in computer science may become useful to me and my potential career direction. My current potential career direction is to become a computer engineer. I have chosen to pursue computer engineering because I want to work with or develop virtual reality technology. Computer science will be useful to my potential career in computer engineering because it teaches me many coding and problem-solving skills that are needing in the field I will be working in.</p>
    
    <p class = "left">A potential situation where this computer science course may become useful for me is during most instances no matter where I work. Computer science has trained me to think logically in order to solve not only coding problems,  mathematical problems, and just regular problem solving in general. In a work situation, many problems come up, and being able to approach a problem from a logical standpoint can be very helpful. This is true especially in engineering, and jobs that require engineers. </p>
    
    <p class = "mid">Another potential situation where computer science may become useful for me is because of how it challenges me to think numerically. During the last three years of computer science, I am constantly working with numbers whether its for calculations in javascript or when trying to animate shapes in canvas. As an engineer, I will be doing a lot of work that has to do with translating and solving problems using numbers. This will be applied not only in my maths and science courses in university, but they will also be used when coding, planning, and creating while working on different projects with computer technology in the workforce. I am very grateful to have learned to manipulate numbers in order to get the end result I need in computer science. </p>
    
    <p class = "right">The final potential situation where this computer science course may become useful for me as a computer engineer is because I am taught programming skills that can be used for various projects. Not only am I able to create a professional website with the skills I was taught, but I am also capable of creating programs to solve tasks as well as display the results on a webpage. Both of these skills can be useful in various work environments. I will be able to utilize what I have learned in computer science if a website is needed for advertisement, or if a program is needed to do calculations or sort data quickly. Also, if another programming language is needed for work, I will be able to learn the language much easier because I already know javascript and many programming languages are similar.
